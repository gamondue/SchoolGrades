# SchoolGrades
SchoolGrades manages the daily life of a teacher in the classroom, with particular attention to evaluation and tracking of topics. 
It is useful also to the student, to know his grades, the questions he answered and the topics covered by the teacher during his teaching. 

SchoolGrades currently has no documentation. Contribution to documentation is welcome and encouraged.

The SchoolGrades user interface is totally in Italian.
The source code of the program is entirely in English.
So, if anyone would like to be involved in the translation into English or another language, please just tell it. We can arrange a way to do it..

SchoolGrades is written in C# with Windows Forms in .Net Core. 

Currently (spring 2021) the program and GitHub are used as an exercitation from some of my classes at school, so many of the pull requests are only intrumental to the school's exercitations.
